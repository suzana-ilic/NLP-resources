### Stanford CS229 I Machine Learning I Building Large Language Models
This lecture provides a concise overview of building a ChatGPT-like LLM, covering both pretraining (language modeling) and post-training (SFT/RLHF). For each component, it explores common practices in data collection, algorithms, and evaluation methods. This guest lecture was delivered by Yann Dubois in Stanford’s CS229: Machine Learning course, in Summer 2024.

### Stanford CS324: Large Language Models (2022 Lecture Notes)
Massive pre-trained language models have transformed the field of Natural Language Processing. They form the basis of all state-of-the-art systems across a wide range of tasks and have shown an impressive ability to generate fluent text and perform few-shot learning. At the same time, these models are hard to understand and give rise to new ethical and scalability challenges. In this Stanford course, students will learn the fundamentals about the modeling, theory, ethics, and systems aspects of large language models, as well as gain hands-on experience working with them.
